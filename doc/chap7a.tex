\section{Introduction}

It is not necessary to use the graphic interface of the program to
watch the results. For the scalar, all the results are in the output
file and for the pictures, it is possible to use directly the exit
files in ascii and to read them through other softwares such as
Matlab, Octave, Siclab,...For example in the directory bin the field
ifdda.m uses matlab to represent the different data.


When the advanced option is chosen, it is possible to choose to save
the data either in separate .mat files or in a single hdf5 file.

\begin{itemize}

\item In the case of the hdf5 file, there are six created groups:
  option (the options chosen by the user), near field (the near field
  data), microscopy (data from the microscopy), far field (data from
  the far field option), and dipole (position of the elements of
  discretization and permittivity).

\item In the case of .mat file, all the output are formatted in the
  form of a unique column vector or two column vectors if the number
  is a complex (the real part being associated with the first column
  and the imaginary part with the second column).

\item In the hdf5 file all the data are formatted under the form of a
  single column vector and with two separate tables in the case of
  complex numbers.

\item In the case where the file contains three-dimensional data,
  these ones are always stored as follows:

\hspace{5mm} {\bf do} i=1,nz

  \hspace{10mm} {\bf do} j=1,ny

 \hspace{15mm} {\bf do} k=1,nx

      \hspace{20mm}  write(*,*) data(i,j,k)
         
   \hspace{15mm} {\bf enddo}

  \hspace{10mm} {\bf enddo}

 \hspace{5mm} {\bf enddo}

 Three-dimensional data are going to be recognized by 3D at the
 beginning of the line.
\end{itemize}
